- **"I'm not that sporty!"** you might be thinking. We say: Yes, you are! Together as a group we ride at a leisurely pace, taking pee/drink and short rest breaks wherever necessary and desirable. We want to experience at least a pleasant, at best an ultra-fun tour together, not a world-class performance in record time. 

- **"But I always do a world-class performance in record time"**  we hear you say right there in the back. You can! We publish our routes here in various formats. If you want to go fast, find a buddy and hit the road when it gets too slow for you. 

- **"But how will I carry my luggage?"**, you might be asking yourself. We understand. Especially on the way there, the luggage situation is often a bit more voluminous. Therefore: For those registered tour participants without professional luggage carrying equipment on their bikes, we will organise a luggage transporter that will take one large piece of luggage and a tent to the nation so that it's just you and the lightness on the bike. Please understand that we cannot offer this service on the way back. We hope that by then you will have either drunk your stuff or found a place for it in the cars of your reality escape helper community.

- **"Surely that costs extra!"**, we can hear you shouting. But no! It's free! NoG is supporting this initative and we'd love to have you with us :)
