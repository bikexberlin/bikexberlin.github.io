## _**"Can I even do this?"**_
As a rough guide: Distances of up to about 40km should be manageable without major problems, even for untrained people with reasonably intact bikes. Longer distances are generally no problem either, but it's best to test that beforehand.

We generally aim for a speed of around 17 km/h.

## _**"What else do I need to remember?"**_
Please check your bike's roadworthiness a few days in advance. We carry some emergency equipment with us, but we can't salvage your grandma's bike, which has been abandoned near the train station three years ago on the tour. Please also remember the following:
- Keys for Pitlocks or similar security systems in case of a breakdown. If you know your bike requires other special tools, please remember to pack them!
- Water
- Sunscreen
- Rain gear
- Helmet (or at least a hat if it's hot)
- Tours >20 km usually include several breaks with shopping opportunities, but it never hurts to have a few snacks with you in case of emergency!

In addition to your bike, please also check your whether you yourself are safe to ride! We reserve the right not to accept anyone we believe could pose a danger to themselves or others.

## _**"Amazing! Me and my full carbon road bike plus aerosuit are ready to go! Where's my Belgian tourniquet?"**_
We'll ride at a leisurely pace and adjust to the slowest riders! If you're up for the Tour de France, download a route, grab a buddy, and go for it!

## _**"Can I join you later?"**_
Our routes are always published in advance. During the trip we use [Critical Maps](https://www.criticalmaps.net/) so that you can see exactly where we are at any time.
