We are a group of people who like to dance to electronic music. At the same time, it is important to us not to leave our ecological conscience at the entrance. In 2017, we came up with the idea of cycling to the festival as COâ‚‚-neutrally as possible. Of course, it would be even better if we could motivate other people to join us. That's how bikeX was born!

Most CO2 emissions at festivals are caused by mobility: especially travelling to and from the festival!
That's why we are still enthusiastic about the idea of travelling to festivals by bike as a group. This not only reduces the ecological footprint - you can also meet new people and network in this way.

We also see travelling by bike as the perfect start of the festival: if you arrive by bike, you can enjoy a last relaxing break before the hustle and bustle of the festival, get a feel for the surroundings and spend your breaks in the most beautiful places.

In order to be able to travel to even more festivals in the future, we are looking forward to meeting new people. If you are interested, please write us!
