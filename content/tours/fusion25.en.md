# With BikeX to Fusion 2025
Want to cycle to Fusion together?

Cycling is fun and allows you to avoid crowded, stuffy trains and buses.
Join us for a medium-sporty, top-class event that's even CO2-neutral! We offer guided bike tours for the journey to Fusion!

## Start:
- Wednesday (June 25th) at 10 a.m.
- Thursday (June 26th) at 10 a.m.

Both tours start at [Birkenwerder S-Bahn station](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=52.75439&mlon=13.24829#map=19/52.75436/13.24828)

The route is approximately 97 km long! In order to tackle that distance, you should at least occasionally cycle longer distances. We estimate 6 hours of pure cycling time, and there will be several stops, some with shopping opportunities.

The group will be accompanied by two or three experienced cyclists who will guide you to your destination. However, we recommend having the routes on your GPS-enabled communication device. As an app with offline maps for the dead spots of Brandenburg, [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net), is a good option.

## Luggage transport
For the first time, both tours will also offer luggage transport! For each rider, we can transport one piece of luggage and a tent or similar item to Lärz. Unfortunately, we cannot offer return transport - please ask your friends and fellow campers for this if possible!

To help us with the planning, please fill out the required **[registration form](https://cloud.etrommer.de/apps/forms/s/4xXrTLXmcynXqn5YeCapqNHt)** by **Sunday, May 22, 2025!**
