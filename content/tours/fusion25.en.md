[Short Version](#short)

Who wants to join us to ride with a bicycle to Fusion festival?
You do not want to board overcrowded, stuffy trains and busses on the way to Lärz.
That’s why we have come up with a medium-sporty event in a class of its own that is also CO2-neutral. We are offering guided bike tours for the journey to Fusion festival:

Wednesday (26.6.) and Thursday (27.06.) morning at 10 AM we will meet to set off from [S-Bhf Oranienburg](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=52.75439&mlon=13.24829#map=19/52.75436/13.24828). The route is about 87 km long.

The group will be accompanied by three experienced cyclists who will pedal with you smoothly to our destination. Nevertheless, we recommend that you have the routes with you on your GPS-compatible communication device. Maps.me, for example, is a good app with offline map material for Brandenburg’s no network spots.

**“A'm i fit enough?”** you might be thinking. Basically you will need a certain fitess to complete the 85km with a minimum riding time of about 5-6h. But together as a group we ride at a leisurely pace, taking pee, drink and short rest breaks wherever necessary and desirable. We want to experience at least a pleasant, at best an ultra-fun tour together, not a world-class performance in record time.

**“But I always do a world-class performance in record time”** we hear you say. And you can! We publish our routes beforehand in various formats. If you want to go fast, find a buddy and hit the road when it gets too slow for you.

**“But how will I carry my luggage?”**, you might be asking yourself. We are not able to provide a luggage transport. Verry Sorry about that.

**"I have a question!?""**, join our Telegram Group: https://t.me/+VUv2dQbU44ZmN2Vi, there we can answer questions and calrify details.
