# By bike to Nation of Gondwana
Who wants to start their trip to the parallel universe by bike? If you want to get to Nation from Berlin, you can do so by bike. Once again this year, you can avoid overcrowded, stuffy trains and shuttle buses and enjoy the route we have scouted out for you.
Following the success of previous years, we are once again organizing a top-class medium-sportive event. This year we are offering four guided bike tours for the journey:

- From the north of Berlin on Friday at **10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.** starting from [Blochplatz am S+U Gesundbrunnen](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=52.54940&mlon=13.38590#map=19/52.54940/13.38590). The route is about 42 km long.
- From Hennigsdorf Friday **11:30 am and 3:30 pm** on the much shorter route. From [Postplatz am S-Bahnhof Hennigsdorf](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=52.63762&mlon=13.20489#map=18/52.63762/13.20489) it is only 22 km to the NoG.

Each group will be accompanied by experienced to-Grünefeld-and-back cyclists who will guide you light-footedly to your destination. Nevertheless, we recommend that you have the routes with you on your GPS-compatible communication device. For example, [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/) is a suitable app with offline maps for Brandenburg's dead spots

## _**"What does it actually cost? ”**_  
Nothing! Nation supports the tours and with a normal Nation festival ticket you can just come along! Only if you want your luggage to be transported there and back do you need a Bike Stage Plus ticket.

## _**"Where do I leave my bike then? ”**_  
You only need a festival ticket for the ride. A [Bike Stage or Bike Stage Plus Ticket](https://www.tixforgigs.com/de-DE/Event/64625/nation-of-gondwana-2025-waldsee-bei-grunefeld-grunefeld-bei-schonwalde) ("bike coat check") is recommended for the safe storage of your bike on site, otherwise you will have to park your bike on the campsite.

## _**”...and what about my luggage? ”**_  
For those tour participants with a [Bike Stage Plus Ticket](https://www.tixforgigs.com/de-DE/Event/64625/nation-of-gondwana-2025-waldsee-bei-grunefeld-grunefeld-bei-schonwalde), we will organize a luggage transport service to take one piece of luggage and a tent to  Nation and back, so that you have your back free for the wind.  On the way there, you simply bring your luggage to the meeting point and get it back directly at the Bike Stage ("bike coat check") on arrival. For the return transport, the luggage must be handed in at the Bike Stage ("bike coat check") by 12:00 noon on Monday. It can then be collected at the bar [Zum Böhmischen Dorf Sanderstraße 11, 12047 Berlin ](https://g.co/kgs/RsFappL) on Monday 21.07 between 6 pm and 10pm and Tuesday between 5 pm and midnight.  
Different from the last years, the transport of luggage requires a Bike Stage Plus Ticket. If you only have a regular ticket, you can of course join - you only have to take your stuff with you on the bike.

## Routes
Over the years we have found two very nice routes to the festival, these will be updated. Even if you want to travel independently from the joint bike tours, you are welcome to use these routes:
